webdev-projects is a group of projects I've been working on to become familiar with PHP and Javascript.

Project 1 - I parsed note.xml using simplexml_load_string() and file_get_contents(), then displayed in the browser with html.

Project 2 - I parsed plant_catalogue.xml and used Bootstrap to organize the data.

Project 3 - Added three buttons to project 2 that displayed plants by their <LIGHT> tag.

Project 4 - I used PHP to create a json file and encode plant_catalogue.xml to json automatically.

Project 4-2 - I parsed the encoded json like Project 2

Project 5 - I added the buttons created in Project 3

Project 6 and 7 were completed within Project 4 through 5

Project 8 - I created a header that styles itself according to the time of day

Project 9 - I parsed the plants based on their shade property and the time of day

Project 10 - The plants are associated with a picture that signifies how much shade or sunlight they need.
